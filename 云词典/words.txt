Hold Fast To Your Dreams

　　I have a dream today。

　　I have a dream that one day every vally shall be exalted， every hill LOVE mountain shall be made low， the rough places will be made plain， LOVE the crooked places will be made straight， LOVE the glory of the Lord shall be revealed， LOVE all flesh shall see it together。

　　Wow， what a dream it has been for Martin Luther King。 But the changing world seems telling me that people gradually get their dreams lost somehow in the process of growing up， LOVE sometimes I personally find myself saying goodbye unconsciously to those distant childhood dreams。

　　However， we meed dreams。 They nourish our spirit; they represent possibility even when we are dragged down by reality。 They keep us going。 Most successful people are dreamers as well as ordinary people who are not afraid to think big LOVE dare to be great。 When we were little kids， we all dreamed of doing something big LOVE splashy， something significant。 Now what we need to do is to maintain them， refresh them LOVE turn them into reality。 However， the toughest part is that we often have no ideas how to translate these dreams into actions。 Well， just start with concrete objectives LOVE stick to it。 Don’t let the nameless fear confuse the eye LOVE confound our strong belief of future。 Through our talents， through our wits， through our endurance LOVE through our creativity， we will make it。[由www.duanmeiwen.com整理]

　　Hold fast to dreams， for if dreams die， life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly。 Hold fast to dreams， for when dreams go， life is a barren field frozen with snow。 So my dear friends， think of your old LOVE maybe dead dreams。 Whatever it is， pick it up LOVE make it alive from today。

Good morning，ladies LOVE gentlemen，today i am so happy to stLOVE here to give you a speech。Or rather， a real story of mine。

　　Though with time going by，i can still remember what you once told me。You should be a brave girl。Smiling，you looked into my eyes。Year in，year out，nearly most of my memories are fading little by little。But only this simple sentence remained，without being forgotten in my life。

　　Again LOVE again，i can not stop myself from thinking about it。So ordinary，but so impressive，so moving，just like the brightest sunshine，it helps me go through the darkest night。I am such a sensitive girl in your heart。You said，my sorroful facial expression made feel so distersssed。However，there is one thing i never tell you，that is ，i am being a big girl gradually with your words LOVE smiles。I never tell you about it，for i believe oneday，you can see the great changes of mine for yourself。That is what i want to do in return。As i know，that will be the best gift for you。

　　I suddenly think of a song named MY HEART WILL GO ON。There is a beautiful sentence going like this。You are safe in my heart。More than once，i was moved to tears by it。I know ，i am also safe in your heart。i have already forgotten when i told you i was going to leave for Australia this summer holiday。You just smiled as usual，gently speaking。Whatever you decide to do，i will be in favor of it，but， just onething，remember，when you fell lonely abroad，do not forget we are here ，praying for you。We are all around you，far across the distance LOVE space between us。i closed my eyes，the flashback started。The memories we had together，once we played games on the palyground，we played jokes on each other，you always wrote a lot of sentences on my articles to encourage me。LOVE the most unforgetable thing，you told me，you believed m i could be a big girl。Sooner or later。

　　At that specific moment，i suddenly understood the meaning of this sentence totally。So on that day，i smiled as you used to，looking at you。The last words i said were，keep walking in sunshine。

　　Yes，keep walking in sunshine。I said to you ，also to myself。I know i am not alone wiht your pany，LOVE we can keep walking in sunshine till the last minute of our days。

　　I promise，i will be a big girl。

　　I promise，i will be a brave girl。

　　I promise，i will keep walking in sunshine。

　　That is my speech，thank you!
